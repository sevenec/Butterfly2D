# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User has identified multiple issues with the Butterfly Nebula Brawl game:
  1. Initial gameplay speed is too slow and needs to be increased
  2. Music system needs improvement - current music is described as "redundant" and "awful", user wants relaxing background music that changes between levels
  3. Brownish collision object (asteroid type) currently doesn't damage player on collision - needs to implement proper collision damage
  4. Health bar system needs to be implemented and visible during gameplay

    message: "Completed implementation of all four critical user issues: 1) Increased initial gameplay speed (Level 1: 2.2→3.2, Level 2: 2.5→3.6), 2) Redesigned music system with relaxing configurations and proper cleanup to prevent layering, 3) Fixed collision damage system to use health-based approach (25 damage per hit), 4) Added comprehensive health bar with color coding and text display. All tasks implemented and ready for backend testing first, then frontend validation."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "✅ BACKEND VERIFICATION COMPLETE - All backend APIs tested and working perfectly! Comprehensive testing completed on all 12 backend endpoints: User Management (registration, get user, update user), Score System (submit score, leaderboard), Game Configuration, Monetization (rewarded ads, social sharing), Flutterer System (catalog, unlock), Daily Challenges, and Database Persistence. All APIs responding correctly with proper data validation, coin calculations, and database persistence. Backend is solid and ready. Main agent can now proceed with frontend testing of the 4 critical user issues: gameplay speed, music system, collision damage, and health bar implementation."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "❌ CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE DISCOVERED: All 4 implemented improvements cannot be tested due to React app failing to load properly. The game is stuck on the loading screen with JavaScript errors in the OpeningScreen component preventing the app from initializing. Root cause: OpeningScreen component has JSX attribute errors causing React to crash. Fixed AudioManager export issue but OpeningScreen still has problems. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must fix OpeningScreen component errors to allow game to load past loading screen before any gameplay features can be validated."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "MUSIC SYSTEM COMPLETELY DISABLED: User expressed strong dissatisfaction 'NOT SATISFIED WITH THE MUSIC - NO MUSIC IS BETTER'. Completely removed the complex 1000+ line procedural music generation system and replaced with minimal AudioManager that has music disabled by default (musicDisabled=true, musicVolume=0). All orchestral/procedural generation code removed. Music system now simply logs 'Music is disabled' and won't play any music. Sound effects remain functional. This directly addresses user's preference for no music over problematic music."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "✅ BACKEND RE-VERIFICATION COMPLETE AFTER MUSIC SYSTEM CHANGES: Comprehensive re-testing of all 12 backend endpoints confirms that disabling the frontend music system has NOT affected any backend functionality. All APIs are working perfectly: User Management (registration: ✅, get user: ✅, update user: ✅), Score System (submit score: ✅ with 297 coins awarded for 15750 score, leaderboard: ✅ with 7 entries), Game Configuration (✅), Monetization (rewarded ads: ✅ with 25 coin reward and proper cooldown, social sharing: ✅ with 15 coin reward), Flutterer System (catalog: ✅ with 10 flutterers, unlock: ✅), Daily Challenges (✅ with 3 challenges), and Database Persistence (✅ with proper coin tracking: 337 total coins, game stats, and flutterer progress). Backend infrastructure is completely stable and unaffected by frontend music changes."
