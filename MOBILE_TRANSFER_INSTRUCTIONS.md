```

## 🔧 Transfer Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Package
You have two options:

**Option A: Individual Files** (Recommended)

**Option B: Compressed Archive**
- Download `/app/butterfly-nebula-brawl-mobile-complete.tar.gz`

### Step 2: Replace Your Cordova `www` Folder

**IMPORTANT**: Backup your current Cordova project first!

1. **Navigate to your Cordova project directory** (where you have config.xml)

2. **Delete current `www` folder contents**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf www/*
   ```

3. **Copy the complete mobile package**:
   - Copy ALL contents from `/app/mobile-package-ready/` into your `www/` folder
   - Make sure to copy EVERYTHING, including subdirectories

4. **Your `www/` folder should now contain**:
   ```
   www/
   ├── index.html
   ├── manifest.json
   ├── sw.js
   ├── asset-manifest.json
   ├── automated-testing.js
   ├── static/

### Step 3: Rebuild Your APK

## 📋 File Verification Checklist

After copying, verify these key files exist in your `www/` folder:

### Core Files:
- [ ] `index.html` (6KB+ optimized version)
- [ ] `manifest.json` (PWA configuration)
- [ ] `static/js/main.*.js` (React app bundle ~143KB)
- [ ] `static/css/main.*.css` (Styles ~14KB)

### Game Engine:
- [ ] `game/AudioManager.js` (~19KB)
- [ ] `game/GameEngine.js` (~54KB) 
- [ ] `game/GameRenderer.js` (~102KB)

### Audio (Most Important):
- [ ] `sounds/intro-cinematic-battle-score.mp3`
- [ ] `sounds/level1-space-epic-cinematic.mp3`
- [ ] `sounds/level2-traveling-through-space.mp3`
- [ ] ... all level tracks (should be ~98MB total)
- [ ] `sounds/sfx/` folder with sound effects

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### APK Still Missing Features:
1. **Verify file copy**: Make sure ALL files were copied, not just some
2. **Check file sizes**: Audio folder should be ~98MB total
3. **Clear cache**: `cordova clean android` before rebuilding
4. **Check paths**: All relative paths should work with `./` prefix

### Audio Not Playing:
1. **Mobile permissions**: Android may need audio permissions
2. **File formats**: All audio is MP3 format (widely supported)
3. **User interaction**: Audio requires user tap to start (handled by opening screen)

### App Crashes on Startup:
1. **Check console logs**: Use `adb logcat` for debugging
2. **Verify HTML**: Make sure index.html is complete
3. **Check config.xml**: Ensure no conflicting configurations

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Transfer files** using instructions above
2. **Rebuild APK** with the complete game content
3. **Test on device** to verify all features work
4. **Upload to Google Play** for internal testing
5. **Plan future updates** (can use same transfer process)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify all files copied correctly (check file sizes)
2. Test on multiple devices if possible
3. Check Cordova logs for specific error messages
4. Compare working web version with mobile version behavior
