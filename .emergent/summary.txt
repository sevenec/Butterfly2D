The previous AI engineer successfully brought Butterfly Nebula Brawl to a feature-complete state, tackling visual polish, mobile optimization, and critical music issues. However, the trajectory reveals a persistent struggle with audio and visual bugs, leading to an iterative debugging process. Key challenges included music overlap (due to inconsistent AudioManager instances and modern browser autoplay restrictions), screen shrinking, a lingering debug stats box, and a critical lack of visual distinction between game levels (obstacles and backgrounds appearing identical). The AI engineer repeatedly attempted fixes, often believing issues were resolved only for the user to report their persistence. This led to deep debugging, including the use of a troubleshoot agent that identified a root cause for audio overlap (multiple  objects). Towards the end, the focus shifted to completing unique obstacle drawing functions and ensuring level configuration properly applied to rendering, with the user still reporting visual issues at the trajectory's conclusion, indicating the visual distinctness problem remains active.

The Butterfly Nebula Brawl game aims to be a high-quality 2D hyper-casual mobile game (Android/iOS), similar to Brawl Stars. Players control a customizable butterfly vertically, dodging obstacles and collecting power-ups across 15 levels, culminating in a Mother Insect boss fight. It includes 10 collectible flutterers with unique skills, and plans for monetization via in-app purchases and AdMob ads, alongside viral features like high scores and daily challenges. The application requires professional polish, including smooth physics, responsive touch controls, particle effects, high-res assets, 60 FPS performance, and a modular codebase. Deployment is prioritized for Google Play (APK) then App Store (IPA).

Current implementation features core gameplay, initial UI (opening/tutorial), and backend integration. Recent work included improving gameplay speed, adding a health bar, enhancing obstacle and boss visuals, and refining the audio system to include 15 unique level tracks plus intro music with comprehensive sound effects. UI buttons and their associated modals (Daily Challenges, Ranks, Flutterers, Sound) are fully functional. The PWA deployment readiness was a key focus, with a build generated and instructions provided, though direct hosting/download is not supported. Despite claims of completion, user feedback in the trajectory highlights ongoing issues with music transitions and lack of visual distinction between levels.

<code_architecture>


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core game logic, state management, and level configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Refined  assignments (lines 56, 280, 1621) to prevent debug stats box.  (line 540) was greatly expanded to define 15 unique visual themes, including , , , and  for each level. The  method (line 1111) was modified to select obstacle types dynamically from , replacing hardcoded 'asteroid'/'insect' choices. Debug logging was added for level configuration.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders all game visuals onto the canvas, including backgrounds, obstacles, and UI.
    -   **Changes**: Calls to  were removed (line 75) to hide the debug stats box. The  function (line 652) was updated to explicitly call  to ensure level-specific backgrounds are rendered. Numerous new obstacle drawing functions (e.g., , , , , etc.) were added to support the diverse  defined in , and  now dispatches to these. The accidentally removed  was re-added.  was updated to utilize level config for colors/effects.  was added to use accent colors.  function was added. Comprehensive  blocks were added around drawing functions for runtime error prevention.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing game rendering, engine integration, and high-level game state.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed inconsistent  vs  usage for  instantiation. A 200ms  delay was introduced in  to fix React timing issues where the canvas wasn't fully mounted before game initialization. Logic for starting intro music on app open was frequently adjusted: initially set, then disabled, then linked to START ADVENTURE, then back to app open (with browser autoplay considerations). Duplicate intro music calls were removed.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralized audio management for music and sound effects.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent significant refactoring multiple times. Initially, complex  and  methods were added with delays. Later, the core architecture was changed to use a *single persistent HTML Audio element* ().  and  now primarily update  and call , which inherently stops the previous track.  and related methods were simplified to pause/clear this single element. Default audio state was toggled between completely silent and having quiet music. Logic was added to resume the  on the *first user interaction* () to bypass modern browser autoplay restrictions. SFX were generally kept disabled or at very low volume. Extensive console logging was added to track audio state and transitions.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the game's initial menu and handles navigation to other screens.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to handle  initialization and intro music starting on app open (with null checks and retry logic). Added a visual indicator ðŸŽµ Click anywhere to start music to inform users about browser autoplay policies.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Web App Manifest for PWA capabilities.
    -   **Changes**: Created, defines PWA properties, icons, and display mode.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Service Worker for PWA offline capabilities and caching.
    -   **Changes**: Created, enables PWA features.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main entry point for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to link  and  for PWA, and updated script tags for , , and  after AudioManager was moved to .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging persistent visual issues: specifically, that obstacles across levels still appeared identical (pink circles) and that background visuals were not changing despite prior attempts to implement level-specific themes. This was a direct follow-up to the user's explicit complaint that the obstacles are still not having variety and the background is still not changing.

Before this specific debugging effort, the AI engineer had just resolved a critical uncaught runtime error that occurred when starting gameplay. This was fixed by adding comprehensive error handling ( blocks) around obstacle drawing functions in , providing a safe fallback to  if a more specific drawing function failed. A new deployment package, , was created reflecting this stability fix.

The current work involves inspecting the code related to obstacle spawning in  and background rendering in . The AI engineer had added debug  statements within 's  function (around line 1111) to inspect the  being passed to ensure it contains correct  and , and similar logs in  for background rendering. The goal is to verify if the level-specific configuration data is correctly propagating and being used by the rendering logic. The music system has been confirmed by the user to be working perfectly and remains untouched during these visual fixes.

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the console logs from the latest build to understand why level-specific obstacle types and background changes are not rendering.
