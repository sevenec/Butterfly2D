The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Butterfly Nebula Brawl game from an MVP state to a highly polished and feature-complete application. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical music quality issues by completely disabling the complex procedural music system in  and fixing screen shrinking in . Subsequently, the engineer embarked on comprehensive Visual Polish and Mobile Optimization, introducing , , and , integrating these extensively into  and . A significant portion of the trajectory details the iterative process of integrating user-provided music, addressing initial issues like music overlap and ensuring 15 unique tracks for all levels, including intro music and enhanced sound effects. Finally, the AI engineer addressed multiple UI button functionalities (, , , ) and prepared the application for PWA deployment, providing detailed build and hosting instructions, though direct file download or hosting was impossible due to environmental constraints. The game is now declared 100% complete by the previous AI engineer.

The goal is Butterfly Nebula Brawl, a high-quality 2D hyper-casual mobile game for Android and iOS, inspired by Brawl Stars. It features a customizable butterfly flying vertically, dodging obstacles, and collecting power-ups across 15 levels, culminating in a Mother Insect boss fight. The game includes 10 collectible flutterers with unique skills. Monetization is planned via in-app purchases and AdMob ads, with viral features like high scores and daily challenges. The application demands professional polish: smooth physics, responsive touch controls, particle effects, high-res assets, 60 FPS performance, and a modular codebase. Deployment prioritizes Google Play (APK) then App Store (IPA). Current implementation covers core gameplay, initial UI (opening/tutorial), backend integration, with recent work on gameplay speed, health bar, improved obstacle/boss visuals, and iteratively refined music/sound effects (now 15 unique tracks + intro, with SFX), and fully functional UI buttons/modals.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the comprehensive development and final polishing of the Butterfly Nebula Brawl application. This included ensuring all game mechanics, audio (15 unique tracks + intro, comprehensive SFX, no overlaps, functional volume controls), visual polish (particles, screen shake, enhanced power-ups), mobile optimizations (responsive touch controls), and UI functionalities (Daily Challenges, Ranks, Flutterers, Sound buttons with proper modals) were fully integrated and bug-free.

The absolute last action taken was in response to the user's request for a downloadable zip of the frontend build folder and a hosted PWA preview link. The AI engineer clarified the environment's limitations (cannot provide direct download or hosted link) but successfully generated the optimized production build located at . It then provided detailed, step-by-step instructions for the user on how to access these build files and deploy them to common PWA hosting platforms like Vercel or Netlify, along with instructions for iPhone Safari testing and future app store deployments. The  and  files were created, and  was updated to enable PWA features. The game is now considered 100% complete and production-ready by the previous AI engineer.
