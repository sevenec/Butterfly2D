The AI engineer successfully progressed the Butterfly Nebula Brawl game development, shifting from an initial MVP state to addressing critical user feedback. The primary focus initially was resolving severe music quality issues, which led to the decision to entirely disable the complex procedural music system in  after the user explicitly stated NO MUSIC IS BETTER. Concurrently, screen shrinking issues in  were fixed. Following this, the user requested Visual Polish and Mobile Optimization. The AI engineer embarked on implementing new systems for particle effects, screen shake, and enhanced touch controls by creating new files (, , ) and integrating them extensively into  and . The work is currently in progress, specifically within .

The goal is a high-quality 2D hyper-casual mobile game, Butterfly Nebula Brawl, inspired by Brawl Stars, for Android and iOS. Core gameplay features a customizable butterfly flying vertically, dodging obstacles (asteroids, insects), and collecting power-ups (speed, blasters). The game is structured across 15 levels with unique backgrounds and culminates in a Mother Insect boss fight. It includes 10 collectible flutterers with unique skills. Monetization is planned via in-app purchases and AdMob ads. Desired viral features include high scores and daily challenges. The application demands professional polish: smooth physics, responsive touch controls, particle effects, high-res assets, 60 FPS performance, and a modular codebase. Deployment prioritizes Google Play (APK) then App Store (IPA). Current implementation covers core gameplay, initial UI (opening/tutorial), backend integration, with recent work on gameplay speed, health bar, improved obstacle/boss visuals, and iterative music quality attempts (now disabled).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two primary areas:
1.  **Music System**: Following user dissatisfaction and a one key music problem, the AI engineer drastically simplified . The complex ULTRA-PREMIUM AUDIO ENGINE for procedural music generation was entirely removed (over 800 lines of code), effectively disabling all background music, as explicitly requested by the user (NO MUSIC IS BETTER). Basic sound effect handling was retained but stripped down. This change was thoroughly tested for both frontend functionality (no music playing, game loading correctly) and backend stability (all APIs working).
2.  **Visual Polish & Mobile Optimization**: After addressing the music, the user requested significant visual and performance enhancements. The AI engineer initiated a multi-phase implementation:
    *   **Phase 1-3**: Created three new core files: , , and . These files are designed to manage new visual effects and improve mobile controls.
    *   **Phase 4**: Began integrating these new systems into . This involved adding initializations for , , and  within the constructor. The  method was updated to use the new mobile input handler. Calls to generate particles and screen shakes were added to  and  methods. The main  loop was modified to process updates for these new systems, and a  method was introduced.
    *   **Phase 5**: Moved on to  to integrate the rendering aspects of the new visual effects. The AI has started updating the  and main  methods to include logic for drawing particles and applying screen effects. The current work halted mid-way through updating , with the AI searching for appropriate locations to add new methods to enhance power-up drawing and performance stats rendering.
