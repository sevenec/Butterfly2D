The AI engineer successfully built the Butterfly Nebula Brawl game from scratch to an initial production-ready state, following the user's comprehensive product requirements. However, upon handover, a series of critical frontend bugs prevented the game from functioning as intended, primarily related to component initialization, rendering, and audio playback. The AI engineer systematically debugged and fixed these issues through multiple iterations. Key steps included resolving  component import errors, rectifying game engine and renderer initialization timing, ensuring correct game state transitions, and diligently debugging audio system integration. Furthermore, the engineer enhanced visual elements (butterflies, obstacles), implemented a multi-level automatic shooting system, and refined the tutorial. The trajectory concludes with the user still reporting music issues and initial gameplay speed concerns, indicating further refinement is needed.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a high-quality 2D hyper-casual mobile game, Butterfly Nebula Brawl, for Android and iOS, inspired by Brawl Stars. The core gameplay involves a customizable butterfly flying vertically in an endless scroller, dodging obstacles (asteroids, insects), and collecting power-ups (speed, blasters). It features 15 levels with unique backgrounds and premium music, culminating in a Mother Insect boss fight on Level 15. The game includes 10 collectible flutterers with unique skills across different rarity tiers. Monetization is planned via in-app purchases for skins/packs and AdMob rewarded/interstitial ads. Viral features like high scores and daily challenges are also desired. The application requires professional polish, including smooth physics, responsive touch controls, particle effects, high-res assets, 60 FPS performance, and modular codebase for future updates. Deployment priority is Google Play (APK), then App Store (IPA). The previous AI engineer completed all initial requirements, building a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Game Development**: HTML5 Canvas for 2D graphics, plain JavaScript for game logic.
-   **Mobile Packaging**: Cordova/PhoneGap (web-to-native wrapper for mobile deployment).
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   **Backend**: PyMongo/Motor for MongoDB interaction, Pydantic for data validation.
-   **Audio**: Web Audio API for synthetic sound and music generation.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Main FastAPI entry point; handles CORS, MongoDB, API routing. No direct changes observed in the trajectory but its role is central for backend operations.
-   ****: Contains core game logic.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted Level 1 speed (from 1.4 to 1.54), implemented multi-level automatic shooting mechanics (single, dual, laser), added  and  methods, enhanced  for blaster levels, and fixed blaster timer reset logic. Also added .
-   ****: Handles drawing game elements.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced rendering of obstacles (asteroids, insects) with visual flair, added logic for butterfly wing fluttering animation, updated  for different projectile types, and added rendering for floating text (e.g., BLASTER LV2!). Corrected its constructor to accept .
-   ****: Primary React component integrating the game.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed missing  import, adjusted  to correctly initiate , ensured  and  are set, made game engine initialization dependent on , corrected  to set  to 'playing', and integrated AudioManager with  for music control. Fixed passing  to .
-   ****: Manages game audio.
    -   **Changes**: Enhanced placeholder sound generation, ensured proper instantiation with , improved music management to stop previous tracks before starting new ones, implemented unique procedural music for each level, and added  for Web Audio API policy compliance.
-   ****: Shadcn UI component for toasts.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed incorrect import paths (e.g.,  changed to ).
-   ****: Main menu component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to also hide the opening screen to ensure correct tutorial display.
-   ****: Renders the game tutorial.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented interactive mouse/touch handling for the movement demo, added a new tutorial step explaining blaster shooting, and included a visual demo for the blaster.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Speed Up Initial Gameplay**: The user requested that the game's initial speed be increased.
-   **Music Enhancement**: The user explicitly stated the music is redundant and awful, requesting relaxation music softly in the background that changes between levels.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several user-reported issues:
1.  **Tutorial Button Not Working**: The tutorial button on the main page failed to transition to the tutorial screen. The AI engineer identified that  in  was not hiding the , leading to a display conflict. A fix was implemented to ensure  when .
2.  **Music Redundancy/Quality**: The user complained about redundant, hypnotizing layered music that didn't change between levels and was generally disliked. The AI engineer previously implemented unique procedural music for each level and refined the  to stop previous tracks and reduce layering by cleaning up existing music nodes, aiming for distinct compositions (e.g., Gentle Cosmic, Energetic Space). Despite these efforts, the user's latest feedback indicates dissatisfaction.
3.  **Butterfly Control with Blaster**: The user found the butterfly difficult to control when the blaster power-up was active. The AI engineer addressed this by reducing the automatic firing rates for all blaster levels (Level 1: 800ms, Level 2: 600ms, Level 3: 400ms) and refining the targeting logic to make the automatic shooting less overwhelming.

All these issues were seemingly fixed by the AI engineer, who declared the game PRODUCTION-PERFECT in Chat Message 411. However, the very next user message (Chat Message 412) contradicted this, indicating that the initial gameplay speed is too slow and the music is still problematic.
